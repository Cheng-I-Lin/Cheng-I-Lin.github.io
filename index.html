                    Game Inspiration:<br>
                    Taiwan, my home country, is suffering from the terrible air pollutions that are polluting the entire
                    Taiwanese population. This could lead to many environmental and health related issues that could
                    have significant impacts. This is why I came up with an idea to try to resolve the air quality 
                    problem while making the learning process an enjoyable one. Through the Air Pollution Quiz game,
                    users can gain crucial knowledge on air pollution with fun interactions.

                    Game Outline/Instruction:<br>
                    Since this game is dedicated to quiz people on the issues and impacts air pollution brings, 
                    the users would try to answer each individual questions that's in would slowly rise up, representing
                    polluted air,
