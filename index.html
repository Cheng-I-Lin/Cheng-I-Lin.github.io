                <br><br><br><h1>About Me</h1>
                Welcome to my home page site where I keep all of the projects that I had previously created. My name is <strong>Cheng-I(Alan) Lin</strong>
                and I am passionate about computer science and its various appliances. I attend the school of <a href="https://www.astaichung.com/"><strong>AST</strong></a>, 
                American School in Taichung, where I attended classes on computer science and learned how to code. Moreover, I studied and practiced coding 
                using the language of <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Python</strong> by myself as well, through the help of online sessions,
                tutoring, and looking at codes/programs created by others online in platforms such as <a href="https://github.com/"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>. 
                As I kept practicing and coding miscellaneous programs, I gradually began to grasp a understanding of how to create useful, meaningful,
                interactive, and enjoyable programs, which then allowed me to start programming more complex projects with a larger scale.<br id="whyCS"><br>
                <h1>Why Computer Science?</h1>
                As technology proliferates and advances, I think it has became extremely crucial for people to learn and understand the power
                and increasing importance of computer science. Nowadays, people can simply stay in their homes and start typing codes to create
                multiple different types of programs dedicated for accomplishing specific tasks. Since we can make programs anywhere with almost
                no materials needed, except for a coding device and maybe the internet, why not start programming to change the world by resolving
                difficult problems that we face recently. Most importantly, as you finish and publish your programs and projects online, everyone who
                uses the internet(basically everyone in the world) can potentially see your creations, allowing you to share your ideas, opinions, and
                teachings in a matter of seconds to the world population. This is why I am currently devoted and determined to share my
                views and thoughts through my programming projects, hoping that others that saw my work would do the same in helping the
                world develop and advance as a whole.

                    Each individual project is designated to solve a particular global issue, promote education and spread
                    knowledge, or stimulate the creativity of users through fun, enjoyable, and interactive processes.<br><br>
                    These projects were created so that they would not only be used as gaming devices that help users to
                    relax, but also tools for educational purposes that may enhance the users' comprehension and understanding
                    of the world and its rich history and disastrous problems.<br><br>
                    All of these programs were coded by myself alone, so I really hope that you would enjoy them and find them
                    interesting and meaningful.

                    <strong>Game Inspiration:</strong><br>
                    During my United States history class back in school, my teacher assigned us to create a project that would
                    fully describe the details of the various European explorations to the Americas during the age of exploration.
                    This is when I came up with a great idea to use my programming skills to turn this project into a reality. With this
                    game, users can learn a significant amount of rich, important history without having to go through boring lectures or 
                    apathetic speeches, but through a pleasant gaming experience.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Game Outline/Instruction:</strong><br>
                    As a player, depicted by the black square at the center of the screen, you get to move around using the up, down, 
                    left, and right arrows. This allows you to move across the map of the United States of America, with clear borders
                    showing each state. By clicking the checkboxes on the top right corner of the screen, the map would change colors to
                    indicate which European country had taken over which part of the United States. There is also a checkbox that shows
                    the various reasons as to why those Europeans came to the Americas at the first place. By moving to different locations,
                    you can press "M" to view more information on the specific, important colonizations and events that happened. Lastly, you 
                    can press "I" to view the settings of the game.

                    <strong>Game Inspiration:</strong><br>
                    Taiwan, my home country, is suffering from the terrible air pollutions that are polluting the entire
                    Taiwanese population. This could lead to many environmental and health related issues that could
                    have significant impacts. This is why I came up with an idea to try to resolve the air quality 
                    problem while making the learning process an enjoyable one. Through QuestionnAIRe,
                    users can gain crucial knowledge on air pollution with fun interactions by answering questions.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Game Outline/Instruction:</strong><br>
                    Since this game is dedicated to quiz people on the issues and impacts air pollution brings, 
                    the users would try to answer each individual questions that's imbedded in a cloud of polluted air, which
                    would slowly rise up to the top of the screen, representing the release of carbon dioxide, methane, and other
                    green house gases to the atmosphere. To stop this, you must type in the correct responses/answers to the questions
                    on the text box on the right of the screen. If you answer all questions correctly, you would win. However, if three
                    polluted gases escape, then you would lose. You can also review or change/add/delete all the questions and answers 
                    to practice and learn more information regarding air quality and air pollution.

                    <h1>Where's the Bomb</h1><br>
                    <strong>Game Inspiration:</strong><br>
                    Growing up, I was always fascinated by the game "Minesweeper", as it allows players to play a puzzling, complex
                    game that requires some thoughts. Now I have the ability to create and code programs, I have decided to try to
                    create a Minesweeper game of my own. However, instead of showing the number of bombs around the tiles, I changed
                    it so that it would show the distance away from the closest bomb. To make it even more interesting, I also added 
                    different setups of the game that allow the users to choose the size of the game and the number of bombs. Moreover,
                    I incorporated various different game modes that the player can choose from, so that they could experience different
                    ways of playing the game.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Game Outline/Instruction:</strong><br>
                    First, by clicking next on the intro page, where all the instructions are stated, the setup page would show up, allowing
                    the players to choose the size of the game tiles and the number of bombs. After that, the player can choose the game mode
                    to play: Regular, Timed(Easy), Timed(Medium), Timed(Hard), Vanishing, Hidden, and Limited Moves. The objective of this game
                    is to click on the different tiles on the screen, which would make the tile disappear, leaving behind a number, which shows
                    the distance(number of tiles) to the closet bomb. After the player clears all the tiles, leaving only the bomb tile untouched,
                    the player wins the game. However, if the player accidentally pressed the bomb tile, then the game ends with the player losing.
                    After each round of game, a restart screen would pop up that allows the player to restart the game and play again.

                    <h1>Multitasking</h1><br>
                    <strong>Game Inspiration:</strong><br>
                    When first creating this game, I was initially going to make a game similar to the google chrome dinosaur game
                    that you can play when there's no wifi. However, after spending some time programming it, I found out that the game
                    lacks complexity. To upgrade the game and make it more difficult, I had this idea of creating four separate smaller
                    games that would make up one bigger game. With this idea, I proceeded to make <strong>Multitasking</strong>, a game
                    where the players must play and survive in four different games in order to win.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Game Outline/Instruction:</strong><br>
                    The first game, Avoid At All Costs, requires the player to use the up and down arrows to control the black block to 
                    either jump or duck the incoming blue blocks. The second game, Falling Collections, requires the player to use the 
                    "A" and "D" keys to move a brown block from left to right to collect the falling blocks. If the falling blocks reach
                    the ground for 5 times, then you lose. The third game, Ping Pong, requires the player to use the "W" and "S" keys to
                    move a platform up and down, playing ping pong. If the ping pong ball reaches the other side of the platform, you lose.
                    The fourth game, Perfect Timing, requires the player to press the space bar until the count reaches a certain number.
                    If the number does not match with the goal number, you lose. As you keep playing, more games would be unlocked and each
                    one of them will get more difficult.

                    <h1>Tower Progression</h1><br>
                    <strong>Game Inspiration:</strong><br>
                    For this game, I wanted to make a game that's different from my other projects. I then came up with the idea of 
                    implementing a porgress bar when I saw another online game that uses the progress bar to gain points that allows
                    the users to upgrade items. This inspired me to try to make a similar gaming environment, with a few slight
                    changes that would make the process of waiting for the loading progress bar more interesting and enjoyable. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Game Outline/Instruction:</strong><br>
                    Wait and be patient. That's all you would have to do as the progress bar slowly fills up to. As soon as the
                    progress bar value hits <strong>100%</strong>, a block would be generated from a random location and start falling down.
                    If a block landed on top of another or on the ground, it would stop falling. By keep creating those blocks, 
                    they would stack on top of each other, building towards a tall skyscraper made of blocks. As you reach a new 
                    height, you would be awarded with <strong>XP</strong> points that you could utilize to upgrade your blocks in four
                    different ways. As the height increases, different types of blocks are also unlocked as new achievements. There is no
                    real end of this game. Only the sky is the limit.

                    For this project, I looked into many 3D games related to the environment to search for inspirations and ideas for
                    my first 3D project that targets the issues of air pollution. This is when I came across a 3D video game called
                    <strong>Endling</strong> and a board game named <strong>Protect Gaia</strong>. Both games are about the dire environmental
                    issues need to be solved, providing me with the idea of the name of the project and the games aspects of the project.
